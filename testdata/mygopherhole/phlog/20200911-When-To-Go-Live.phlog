joshcom.net - When To Go Live
[===================================================================]

I'm not sure when to point joshcom.net to my IP, and open the gopher
port up.  Should I abandon that mission, and instead move this to a
pubnix or tilde site?  I suppose I could do both.

It's going to rain this weekend, and then warm up a bit next week.
I'll have to mow at least one more time before I move to a house
with no grass to mow. Lookin' forward to it.
