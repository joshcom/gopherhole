I promise.

I've been on a coding kick recently, and I'm forcing myself to keep
my personal programming projects to the mornings before work.  I
found earlier this year if I write code for too long in the evening,
I'll often enter a weird semiconscious state as I start to drift off
to sleep, where my mind will start trying to solve nonsense problems
in whatever language I was coding in.  It feels like I'm inches away
from the solution, though I can't quite make sense of what it
is I'm trying to solve.  I'll even enter a mild fight-or-flight
response, as my brain is convinced this is an urgent task to be
completed _now_.

So, yeah, that's my little story about why I don't code at night.

Time to hobble downstairs to the litter box.  After I check out a
few more things...
