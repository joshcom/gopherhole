joshcom.net - Sleeping (Or Lack Thereof)
[===================================================================]

I read a book awhile back called "Why We Sleep", and it went into the
many benefits of (and detriments of not) getting seven-to-eight hours
of sleep each night.  Between there not being enough hours in the day
as it is to do all the things I want to do, and the eagerness to begin
the next day that comes over me as soon as my head hits the pillow, I
don't think I'll be breaking the seven hour mark consistently any time
soon.

On paper, I do everything right to be a good sleeper.  I work out for at
least an hour, six days a week.  At least a half-hour of that workout is
cardio.  I rarely bring anxieties or regrets to bed.  I have a consistent
routine every night, I avoid drugs and alcohol, and I step away from all
screens to read a book in the half hour (or so) leading up to bed.

Most nights I fall asleep fast enough.  I can actually watch my thoughts
in bed (which I have to do -- as I said, I immediately start thinking about
what I want to do when I wake up.  Suddenly, I'll be out.  Then comes a series
of awakenings, most of which I suspect my wife is the culprit, but all the
same, I'll glance at the clock, hoping it's at least 4am.  It won't be, for
at least a few laps.  Finally, 4am will come along, and I can spring out of bed,
brew some coffee, and hang out with my dog for several hours before I begin
work.

I don't care that I don't sleep as much as (they say) I should.  I'd just as
soon push a button, skip to the morning, and feel rested enough.  Dreams
should be the sell, but they don't do much for me anymore.  Every now and
then, I'll have a vivid, wild-ride of a dream that I used to have when I was
younger, but even then, I'm fairly apathetic to the experience.
