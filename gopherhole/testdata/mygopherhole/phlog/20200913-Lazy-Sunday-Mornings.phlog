[===================================================================]

Before our baby comes, I'm taking advantage of the        ( ( (
free time I have available to on weekend mornings       _(_(_(_(
(and workday evenings).  In the past two weeks, I've   |        |_
discovered that gopherholes, tilde gruops, and         |********| |
pubnix were all things.  I've also started hacking     |        |/
away at a few golang and python projects. Oh,          |________|
right, and I set up this gopherhole.                    |______|

For years, my weekend morning routine has been to drink 
coffee and play video games until my wife awoke.  I'm an early riser,
and she sleeps in, so that's been my sliver of time to log a few 
hours on my xbox or switch.

I've lost my way with computing over the years. The web feels bloated
and somehow more impersonal, even with almost everybody on facebook,
instagram, etc.  Hell, in a lot of ways, it feels like these deepening
social media serves have made many personal interactions shallow as
well.  Visiting family, there will often be a living room full of
relatives all staring at their phone, scrolling through their
newsfeeds.  Instead of discussing, verbally sharing stories or 
even huddling in a circle as everyone flips through photos of a 
vacation (or birth, or whatever) together, we're sharing links or
saying, "check out my <social media platform of choice>!"

I remember in the 90s, when I first started BBSing, wishing there 
were more people on the boards to talk to.  For me, the 
sweet spot may have been in the late 90s and early 00s, when 
chatrooms and discussion boards were plentiful but not 
unmanageably saturated, and by having an active personal blog 
you'd almost certainly make at least a handful of connections.

It feels like I may have finally found a nitch again I've been
missing -- something or things that can slip in alongside
the rest of my life, without shadowing any of my other activities
or social interactions, while also not being a mere nostalgia trip.
