joshcom.net - It's A Boy!
[===================================================================]

Today is day one of week 12, the last week of our first trimester, and 
we received the results from our NIPS test.  No problems detected, and 
we're having a boy!

We figured as much.  We've had a girl's name picked out since six months 
before got our pink stripe.  Heather wanted a girl _slightly_ more than 
a boy, only because she's historically felt outgendered in the household 
and at family gatherings.  I can nerd out just as well with a boy or a 
girl, so I could have cared less what the result was.
