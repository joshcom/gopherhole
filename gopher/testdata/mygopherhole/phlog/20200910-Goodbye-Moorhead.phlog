joshcom.net - Goodbye, Moorhead
[===================================================================]

After modest negotiations with the buyers of our house, this afternoon
we all signed the sales contract.  I missed my wife's text that they
had agreed to our counter, so after a few hours of all parties waiting
for me to add my signature, our realtor nicely nudged me to get my act
together with a text message.

I should look into a better publishing system for my phlog.  VIM's fine --
I use it all day at work instead of an IDE -- but there's a lot of boilerplate
I'm copying for each entry.  I suppose it's easy enough to throw together
a bash script to generate all this based on a title.  I do need to look
into this 'mole' CGI script dealio I read about though, too...
