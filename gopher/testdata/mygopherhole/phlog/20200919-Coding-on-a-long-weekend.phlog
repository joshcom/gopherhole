    |  ______________  |  Plenty of gopher server software already 
    | |              | |  exists (currently, this gopherhole uses
    | | $ vim        | |  pygopherd), but as part of my effort to
    | |              | |  become proficient in golang, as well as my
    | |______________| |  general desire to use  my own software  
    |_~______________~_|  when I can, I started building my own 
    / ..............   /  gopher server this morning.
   /  = = = = = = =   /
  /  = = = = = = =   /  I think this'll be a fairly quick project.
 / #   _______   #  /  The serverside of the protocol, at least what
/_____/______/_____/  I'm seeing in RFC-1436, looks simple enough.
                     Perhaps I should write a client as well...

I'm also realizing that, especially by hosting my own gopherhole
where I don't _think_ crawlers and aggregators can find me, visitors
are unlikely.  I've caught a few IPs I don't recognize, but overall, 
I may be an undetectable rogue planet floating around the internet.
